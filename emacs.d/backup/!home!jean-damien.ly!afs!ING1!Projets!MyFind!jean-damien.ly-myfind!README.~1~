README for MyFind Project:

This is a simplified version of the find(1) command.
This is an EPITA school project for the third year students.
It took less than a week to make this project.

This binary follows this format : ./myfind [options] [files] [expression]

Available commands for myfind:
          OPTIONS:
                — -d: process each directory’s content before the directory
                itself. By default, myfind visits directories in pre-order
                (before their contents).
                — -H: does not follow symbolic links,
                except if it is given in the command line.
                —
                -L
                :
                myfind
                follows symbolic links.
                —
                -P
                :
                myfind
                never follows symbolic links.  This is the default behavior.

Makefile:
        — all:  Produces the myfind binary
        — check:  Run the testsuite with myfind binary
        — clean:  Delete everything produced by make
